        For the winter break I decided to travel around South East Asia. As I had no exams, I could start early. <br/><br/> 
        My first stop was the Philipines. The purpose of this trip was to go diving. We first hesitated between Palawan and Cebu but as Palawan was too far away from the international Airport in Cebu and that we had friends that went to Panglao, an island just next to Cebu, we decided to do the same. We first stayed in the same place they recommended us, which was very nice but far from the main beaches. So, after half way of our stay, we switched accomodation. It is very easy and cheap to move in the island. There are tricycles, which are motorbikes with seats next to it, a bit like a sidecar. Bargaining their price became the main activity of our stay. <br/><br/>

        The first night we went to the main beach : Alona beach. We arrived there for the sunset, which was beautiful and very pink. The days after we went to the Hinagdanan cave where we could swim in its lake. This was one of my favorite things we did. We also went for a tour in bohol, which is a largest island just north to Panglao. We were supposed to be in a group tour but as there was no more space in the minibus, they gave us a private car for the same price (the same day they also upgraded us into a private room for our last night, which was very nice). The tour consisted in, first, having lunch in a cruise on a turquoise river in the middle of the wild nature. Then, we went to the chocolate hills. They are little hills that were made of sediments, they were shaped when the island was created. Their name comes from the fact that they turn brown, leaving the impression of large chocolate seeds (at least that is what we guessed). We then went to see tarsiers, the smallest primates on earth. There are two places to see tarsiers in Bohol: one where they keep them awake all day for people to see them and the other one where they are kept in the wild and where it isn't 100% sure to see them. We thought that we were going to the wild one as it was written on the tour guide, but in fact we went to the other one. So we decided not to see them, as they weren't respectful of wildlife. On the way there, we passed through a man-made forest, which was huge. It was bild in order to protect the hills' ground from the rain. We then stopped at bamboo bridges which were fun to go on. Our last stop was the city's middle age-style church. The tour was nice but nothing exceptional. We finished the day going to Doljo Beach where the sunset point is. Sadly, the sunset point indicated on the map was unreachable. So we just stayed at the beach and had some dinner in a very local place where everyone was doing karaoke. The mix of music between them singing and the Christmas songs displayed in the restaurant gave an interesting vibe to this evening.

        The next day we went to Dumaluan Beach. It was a beautiful beach, a lot less touristy than Alona beach. We stayed there the whole day. We saw many starfish in the see and saw the begining of the sunset. The sun in the Philippines sets a 5-5h30 and it gets dark very quickly.
        <br/><br/>
        On Tuesday, we finally went diving. We decided to do 3 dives in Balicasag, which is a protected marine sanctuary. It was an incredible experience. There were a lot of corals and fishes of all species. We saw trumpetfish, lionfish, clownfish, seasnakes which are the most poisonous animal in the ocean... But the most impressive dives were our second and third dives. On the second dive, we saw a lot of turtles. They were huge and came very close to us. The third dive, our dive master brought us to a school of jackfish. It was gigantic and we could swim between them. We thought we only stayed there 5 min but our diving instructor told us, once back on the boat, that we stayed 20 min. It's incredible how time passes underwater. The last dives were also a bit of an adventure as it started raining and storming a bit. Underwater was completely calm but as soon as we reached the surface we had to be quick and smart on getting back on the boat. This day was the most memorable day of our trip. <br/><br/>

        On the last days we chilled, played cards, went to the beach, tried to get back our lost laundry items, ate burritos from a tuktuk stall, smoothie balls from a cool vibes Cafe and had a bad experience trying to ride a motorbike to go to waterfalls. The last days were also quite (or sometimes strongly) rainy so we couldn't do as much as the first days.

        <br/><br/>
        Overall it was a very chill and relaxing 9 days in the Philippines. And one of my goals for my first year abroad (which was to be on white sand palm-tree turquoise beaches during winter time) was accomplished.<br/><br/>
