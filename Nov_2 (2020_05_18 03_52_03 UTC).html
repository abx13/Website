        My second destination was Myanmar. A lot of people told me it was a beautiful country. I didn't know a lot about it, but one of my friends really wanted to go there, so I said why not? And now, I don't regret it at all. I am writing this a while after this trip so I don't have all the exact memories. But one thing is very clear in my mind : Myanmar is truly beautiful. You must go visit this country.

        We landed in Yangon, the former capital. We had 1 day to visit it before taking a night bus to Mandalay. We saw the 4 pagodas, a Chinese temple and the colonial district. We quickly understood that the main element of Myanmar was gold. All their pagodas were covered in gold leaves. The most striking padoda is the Schwedagon pagoda. It is the main one, so you won't miss it. But I advise you to do it at the end because otherwise you will be very disapointed about the other ones, which are still beautiful. We learned that Myanmar had 8 days in a week as they divide Wednesday in 2 days: Wednesday morning and Wednesday afternoon. One animal is assigned to each day and is called a nat. In the pagodas there is a circle where the different nats' statues are set. Depending on what day you were born, you have a nat you adore. You have to water it 3 times with the little cups set on the side and then hit the gong 3 times with the bamboo stick.
Let's get back to the Schwedagon pagoda. It is gigantic, massive and expressive. After climbing many stairs, we arrived at the pagoda and we were just blown minded. It is a 98m high stupa covered in gold. With the blue sky and the intense sun, the golden stupa enlighted everything and all the white and gold temples arround made this light even more intense. You think the stupa is everything but no. There are so many different temples around it that after a very long time getting lost in them we thought we did it all, but we had a quarter more to go. It was huge. When we got lost and went back to the central stupa, we had the same blown away feeling as the first time. While we were stilled impressed, we went to eat shan noodles (rice noodles with peanut sauce) and headed to the bus station to get to Mandalay.

        TFriends told us the buses were nice but we didn't expected it as nice. Our bus company, JJ express, had a motto that truly represented it : as a plane in the sky, JJ on the roads. We had screens, blankets, food, drinks, lay down seats, everything you wished for. We were then very happy we took all our transportation as night buses. The only thing is that drivers were very fast and we arrived every time 1 to 2h in advance. And when you're supposed to arrive at 5 am, you're not very happy to arrive that early in advance. Gratefully, all our hostels gave us the room when we arrived, so we could actually sleep before starting our day.

        Mandalay is not the most charming city but what is really worth is all the former emperial cities around it. Mingun was our favorite. It is an all white curvy pagoda. The second day we visited Mandalay. We saw how they shaped gold into gold leaves, we visited the jade market and different pagodas. The next day

        On the last days we chilled, played cards, went to the beach, tried to get back our lost laundry items, ate burritos from a tuktuk stall, smoothie balls from a cool vibes Cafe and had a bad experience trying to ride a motorbike to go to waterfalls. The last days were also quite (or sometimes strongly) rainy so we couldn't do as much as the first days.

        Overall it was a very chill and relaxing 9 days in the Philippines. And one of my goals for my first year abroad (which was to be on white sand palm-tree turquoise beaches during winter time) was accomplished.<br/><br/>
