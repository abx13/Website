# Website

This repository contains the files used for creating my personal website. 

It all started as a challenge to myself. Could I code a website from scratch?

It is not the content that I would put on it that interested me but the process of creating the website on my own. 
This is why, once created, I did not upload much content.

I was just happy and proud of having succeeded at my set goal. 
I learned to code in  HTML and CSS, researched how to achieve certain formats, tried many different versions, until I was satisfied with this one. 

Here it is. 

Enjoy :)
