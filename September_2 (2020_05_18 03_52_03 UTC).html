        Tioman is an island in Malaysia well know to be one of the best diving spots in South East Asia. With YNC, I had the opportunity to go there to get certified for open water diving. So I just jumped on the occasion.  <br/><br/>

       After a theory and pool session to get used to the equipment and the diving rules, we went to Tioman to actually get certified. <br/> <br/>

        We departed from Singapore on Friday evening and, after a bus and boat ride, arrived to Tioman at 3:00 am. We then woke up at 8:00 am to get on the boat for our first diving experience. The two first dives we did were to only practice the skills ( descending, retrieving and cleaning our mask under water, air sharing when helping someone out of air, ascending, neutral buoyancy, etc.)

        Our third dive, we continued practicing the skills but swimming around. We saw a lot of clown fishes, nudibranch, barracuda, and a lot of other fishes which I don't know the name. We were on an area that had corals everywhere. It was really impressive. We also went to the "playground", which is an area with a structure made of pipelines and a treadmill next to it. It was really fun and we didn't expect that at all under water. After this whole day of diving, we just wanted to dive more. We came back on the island to have dinner, chill and then went back to bed to wake up the next morning at 7:00 am for our last dive.

        This forth dive was the best one. We went to the same diving sport as our third dive. We saw the coral reef and all the fishes again, still as impressive. But the best part is that we saw a turtle! Everyone told be before hand that Tioman was a well-known diving spot to see turtles and I really wanted to see one. It was stunning. Our instructor also brought us to see a ship. That was also breath-taking (however, rule nÂ°1 in diving is : do not hold your breath ðŸ˜‰). After this, we all got certified, which mean that now we can go diving wherever we want! and! We will definetly do it as this trip was amazing! We actually plan to go diving in the Philippines in December with all the exchange students that have their diving licence. I'm really looking forward to it, I can't wait to dive again!
